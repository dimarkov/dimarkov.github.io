# About
I am a PostDoc at [TU Dresden, Chair for Neuroimaging](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_mathematik_und_naturwissenschaften/fachrichtung_psychologie/i1/ni). 
In short, my research interests are at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. My current 
work is focused on understanding the computational mechanisms that underly human decision making, by 
applying concepts from information theory and probability theory to model human adaptive behavior and 
test the experimental predictons derived from this computational frameworks.
