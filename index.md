PostDoc at TU Dresden, [Chair of Neuroimaging](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_mathematik_und_naturwissenschaften/fachrichtung_psychologie/i1/ni).

I am interested in understanding computational principles and representations which humans employ to navigate complex 
and dynamic everyday environmnet. My current work is focused on mechanisms that underlie learning, inference and planning 
in dynamic environments and in the presence of varoius sources of uncertainty. Hence, I try to describe this processes in 
the context of Bayesian inference, planning as inference and active inference. My approach consist of analysing human 
behavior from the perspective of probailistic behavioral models, that is, rational agents. Recently, I started exploring 
how perception of time and durations is incorporated within structures which humans use to represent dynamic environments. 
An interesting question here is how temporal representations modulate the decision-making process and under which conditions 
it might lead to 'suboptimal' decision making. On a long run I am interested on connecting the normative models of human 
behavior to neuronal level and self-orginizing plasticity mechanisms which shape neuronal dynamics. 

I am currently employed at the SFB 940/2 A9 project. Here is an up-to-date [curriculum vitae](/files/resumeDM.pdf).
