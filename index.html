I am a PostDoc at [TU Dresden, Chair for Neuroimaging](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/fakultaeten/fakultaet_mathematik_und_naturwissenschaften/fachrichtung_psychologie/i1/ni).
My research interests are at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience, machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. My current
work is focused on understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie human decision making, by
applying concepts from information theory and probability theory to model human adaptive behaviour and
test the experimental predictions derived from these computational models.
